The definition and the functions of cryptocurrency are discussed in the framework of descriptive and theoretical analysis. The paper systematized the existing approaches to the concept analysis of cryptocurrency; the place of cryptocurrency in modern economic theory is shown.The article concludes that cryptocurrencies are often determined through the set of basic characteristics. Cryptocurrencies are not money, though they can perform the main function of money - to be a means of payment; they can be a means of making settlements, assets, platforms for concluding smart contracts, a means for crowdfunding. They are not private money in Hayek's interpretation. Cryptocurrencies can be described in the framework of the models of new monetarism (payment economics).},

However, the exiting consensus algorithms suffer from performance bottleneck such as low throughput, high delay, unstable performance, sustainability issues and vulnerability to targeted attacks. In this paper, we propose a new consortium blockchain consensus algorithm, referred to as Weighted Byzantine Fault Tolerance (WBFT) consensus algorithm that improves system throughput and consensus delay. We introduce a dynamic weighting mechanism for consensus nodes, which enhances the security of blockchain system by weakening the influence of malicious nodes and reduces the probability of malicious behavior. We validate the performance of WBFT experimentally and compare it against Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) and Reputation-Based Byzantine Fault-Tolerance (RBFT) based approaches. The results show that WBFT substantially outperforms PBFT and RBFT in terms of system throughput, consensus delay and security.},

On the other hand, in order to generate a new consensus block, Proof of Work (PoW) based blockchain systems routinely perform a huge amount of computation that does not achieve practical purposes but to solving a difficult cryptographic hash puzzle problem.In this study, we propose a new consensus mechanism, Proof of Learning (PoLe), which directs the computation spent for block consensus toward optimization of neural networks. In our design, the training and testing data are released to the entire blockchain network and the consensus nodes train NN models on the data, which serves as the proof of learning. As a core component of PoLe, we design a secure mapping layer (SML) to prevent consensus nodes from cheating, which can be straightforwardly implemented as a linear NN layer. When the consensus on the blockchain network is achieved, a new block is appended to the blockchain. We experimentally compare the PoLe protocol with Proof of Work (PoW) and show that PoLe can achieve a more stable block generation rate, which leads to more efficient transaction processing. Experimental evaluation also shows the PoLe can achieve a stable block generation rate without significantly sacrificing training performance.},

   abstract = {A typical blockchain protocol uses consensus to make sure that mutually mistrusting users agree on the order in which their operations on shared data are executed. It is known, however, that asset transfer systems, by far the most popular application of blockchains, can be implemented without consensus. Assuming that no account can be accessed concurrently, i.e., that every account belongs to a single owner, one can efficiently implement an asset transfer system in a purely asynchronous, consensus-free manner. It has been also shown that asset transfer with shared accounts is impossible to implement without consensus. In this paper, we propose CryptoConcurrency, an asset transfer protocol that allows concurrent accesses to be processed in parallel, without involving consensus, whenever possible. More precisely, if concurrent transfer operations on a given account do not lead to overspending, i.e., can all be applied without the account balance going below zero, they proceed in parallel. Otherwise, the account's owners may have to access an external consensus object. We allow each account to use its own consensus implementation, which only the owners of this account trust.},

Large-scale concurrent access for massive wireless devices to accomplish the consensus procedure may consume prohibitive communication and computing resources, and thus may limit the application of blockchain in wireless conditions. As most existing consensus protocols are designed for wired networks, directly apply them for wireless users may exhaust their scarce spectrum and computing resources. In this paper, we propose AirCon, a byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus protocol for wireless users via the over-the-air computation. The novelty of AirCon is to take advantage of the intrinsic characteristic of the wireless channel and automatically achieve the consensus in the physical layer while receiving from the end users, which greatly reduces the communication and computational cost that would be caused by traditional consensus protocols. We implement the AirCon protocol integrated into an LTE system and provide solutions to the critical issues for over-the-air consensus implementation. Experimental results are provided to show the feasibility of the proposed protocol, and simulation results to show the performance of the AirCon protocol under different wireless conditions.},

   abstract = {For permissionless blockchains, scalability is paramount. While current technologies still fail to address this problem fully, many research works propose sharding or other techniques that extensively adopt parallel processing of transactions. In these approaches, a potentially large number of committees of nodes independently perform consensus and process new transactions. Hence, in addition to regular intra-committee communication, (1) new transactions have to be delivered to the right committee, (2) committees need to communicate to process inter-shard transactions or (3) to exchange intermediate results. To contrast slowly adaptive adversaries, committees should be frequently changed. However, efficient communication to frequently-changing committees is hard. We propose a simple approach that allows us to implicitly select committee members and effectively deliver messages to all members of a specific committee, even when committees are changed frequently. The aim of our design is to provide a committee selection procedure and a committee-targeted communication primitive to be applied in most of the scalable blockchain architectures that are currently proposed in literature. We provide a theoretical proof of the security of our approach and first experimental results that shows that our approach might be feasible in practice.},

Emerging technologies such as blockchains benefit massively from applying threshold cryptography in consensus protocols, randomness beacons, and threshold signatures. However, blockchains and smart contracts also enable further improvements of DKG protocols by providing a decentralized computation and communication platform. For that reason, we propose a DKG protocol that uses smart contracts to ensure the correct execution of the protocol, allow dynamic participation, and provide crypto-economic incentives to encourage honest behavior. The DKG protocol uses a dispute and key derivation mechanism based on Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs) to reduce the costs of applying smart contracts by moving the computations off-chain, where the smart contract only verifies the correctness of the computation.},

Blockchain, as a trust machine, is a cooperative institution in cyberspace that supports cooperation through distributed trust with consensus protocols. While studies in computer science focus on fault tolerance problems with consensus algorithms, economic research utilizes incentive designs to analyze agent behaviors. To achieve cooperation on blockchains, emerging interdisciplinary research introduces rationality and game-theoretical solution concepts to study the equilibrium outcomes of various consensus protocols. However, existing studies do not consider the possibility for agents to learn from historical observations. Therefore, we abstract a general consensus protocol as a dynamic game environment, apply a solution concept of bounded rationality to model agent behavior, and resolve the initial conditions for three different stable equilibria. In our game, agents imitatively learn the global history in an evolutionary process toward equilibria, for which we evaluate the outcomes from both computing and economic perspectives in terms of safety, liveness, validity, and social welfare. Our research contributes to the literature across disciplines, including distributed consensus in computer science, game theory in economics on blockchain consensus, evolutionary game theory at the intersection of biology and economics, bounded rationality at the interplay between psychology and economics, and cooperative AI with joint insights into computing and social science. Finally, we discuss that future protocol design can better achieve the most desired outcomes of our honest stable equilibria by increasing the reward-punishment ratio and lowering both the cost-punishment ratio and the pivotality rate.},

   abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have the potential to establish flexible and reliable emergency networks in disaster sites when terrestrial communication infrastructures go down. Nevertheless, potential security threats may occur on UAVs during data transmissions due to the untrusted environment and open-access UAV networks. Moreover, UAVs typically have limited battery and computation capacity, making them unaffordable for heavy security provisioning operations when performing complicated rescue tasks. In this paper, we develop RescueChain, a secure and efficient information sharing scheme for UAV-assisted disaster rescue. Specifically, we first implement a lightweight blockchain-based framework to safeguard data sharing under disasters and immutably trace misbehaving entities. A reputation-based consensus protocol is devised to adapt the weakly connected environment with improved consensus efficiency and promoted UAVs' honest behaviors. Furthermore, we introduce a novel vehicular fog computing (VFC)-based off-chain mechanism by leveraging ground vehicles as moving fog nodes to offload UAVs' heavy data processing and storage tasks. To offload computational tasks from the UAVs to ground vehicles having idle computing resources, an optimal allocation strategy is developed by choosing payoffs that achieve equilibrium in a Stackelberg game formulation of the allocation problem. For lack of sufficient knowledge on network model parameters and users' private cost parameters in practical environment, we also design a two-tier deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm to seek the optimal payment and resource strategies of UAVs and vehicles with improved learning efficiency. Simulation results show that RescueChain can effectively accelerate consensus process, improve offloading efficiency, reduce energy consumption, and enhance user payoffs.},

Examples of these networks include smart home networks, wireless sensor networks, Internet of Flying Things, and many others. One of the main difficulties that confront these networks is the security of their information and communications. A large number of solutions have been proposed to safeguard these networks from various types of cyberattacks. Among these solutions is the blockchain, which gained popularity in the last few years due to its strong security characteristics, such as immutability, cryptography, and distributed consensus. However, implementing the blockchain framework within the devices of these networks is very challenging, due to the limited resources of these devices and the resource-demanding requirements of the blockchain. For this reason, a large number of researchers proposed various types of lightweight blockchain solutions for resource-constrained networks. The "lightweight" aspect can be related to the blockchain architecture, device authentication, cryptography model, consensus algorithm, or storage method. In this paper, we present a taxonomy of the lightweight blockchain solutions that have been proposed in the literature and discuss the different methods that have been applied so far in each "lightweight" category.

Threats to data integrity are thus of paramount relevance, as tampering with data may maliciously affect crucial business decisions. This issue is especially true in cloud computing environments, where data owners cannot control fundamental data aspects, like the physical storage of data and the control of its accesses. Blockchain has recently emerged as a fascinating technology which, among others, provides compelling properties about data integrity. Using the blockchain to face data integrity threats seems to be a natural choice, but its current limitations of low throughput, high latency, and weak stability hinder the practical feasibility of any blockchain-based solutions. In this paper, by focusing on a case study from the European SUNFISH project, which concerns the design of a secure by-design cloud federation platform for the public sector, we precisely delineate the actual data integrity needs of cloud computing environments and the research questions to be tackled to adopt blockchain-based databases. First, we detail the open research questions and the difficulties inherent in addressing them. Then, we outline a preliminary design of an effective blockchain-based database for cloud computing environments.},

   abstract = {There are some alternative Cryptocurrency systems which claim that they are based on PoS are actually based on PoSTW which denotes the Proof of Stake(coin), Time(day) and Work(hashing), while the other pure PoS Cryptocurrency systems are actually centralized. In this paper we propose a new framework of Cryptocurrency system. The major parts what we have changed include, a fast transparent distribution solution which can avoid deceptions between the sponsor and the audience, removing the bloated history transactions from data synchronization, no mining, no blockchain, it's environmentally friendly, no checkpoint, no exchange hub needed, it's truly decentralized and purely based on proof of stake. The logic is very simple and intuitive, 51% of stakes talk. The highlight of this paper is a proposal of a new concise data synchronization mechanism named "Converged Consensus" which ensures the system reaches a consistent distributed consensus. We think the famous blockchain mechanism based on PoW is no longer an essential element of a Cryptocurrency system. In aspect of security, we propose TILP & SSS strategies to secure our system. At the end, we try to give an explicit definition of decentralization. 1 Transparent distribution As the new system is purely based on proof of stake, naturally, we must have an initial statistical distribution of stakes among the users. In this new framework, the initial distribution of stakes and the implement of the system is completely separated and independent. The initial distribution of stakes is just treated as a parameter to be input into the system, a different initial distribution of stakes means a different Cryptocurrency system. Whatever way the initial distribution is acquired, it's qualified if it's widely acknowledged and trusted by the users. We can even directly fork a distribution of stakes in the blockchain of some existing Cryptocurrency system, such as Bitcoin system, to be input into a new system, then the new system which inherited the distribution of stakes of the Bitcoin system will start to run under the new framework [APPENDIX A]. Here, we'd like to introduce a new method of fast distribution of stakes within several months. It's a completely transparent distribution, no one can cheat including the sponsor himself. Suppose an internet company X-Company plans to issue 10 billion of Cryptocurrency named "X-Coin". Who are the audience of the distribution? All existing accounts from some existing Cryptocurrency systems, say Bitcoin Litecoin or Dogecoin(sorry, there is no absolutely fair distribution), which had activities before the day Jan 1st, 2014 and the balance is above zero. What's the manner? A qualified participator signs a message with his old private key of the original system and sends it to the X-Company to register an account. The message consists of the old public key of the original system and the new public key of the X-Coin system. If the message is verified by the X-Company, he will be given some free(or for sale, it depends) stakes. An example division of stakes is, the X},

@report{Kiayias2015,
   abstract = {>IJH=?J Transaction processing speed is one of the major considerations in cryptocurrencies that are based on proof of work (POW) such as Bitcoin. At an intuitive level it is widely understood that processing speed is at odds with the security aspects of the underlying POW based consensus mechanism of such protocols, nevertheless the tradeo between the two properties is still not well understood. In this work, motivated by recent work [9] in the formal analysis of the Bitcoin backbone protocol, we investigate the tradeo between provable security and transaction processing speed viewing the latter as a function of the block generation rate. We introduce a new formal property of blockchain protocols, called chain growth, and we show it is fundamental for arguing the security of a robust transaction ledger. We strengthen the results of [9] showing for the rst time that reasonable security bounds hold even for the faster (than Bitcoin's) block generation rates that have been adopted by several major alt-coins (including Litecoin, Dogecoin etc.). We then provide a rst formal security proof of the GHOST rule for blockchain protocols. The GHOST rule was put forth in [14] as a mechanism to improve transaction processing speed and a variant of the rule is adopted by Ethereum. Our security analysis of the GHOST backbone matches our new analysis for Bitcoin in terms of the common prex property but falls short in terms of chain growth where we provide an attack that substantially reduces the chain speed compared to Bitcoin. While our results establish the GHOST variant as a provably secure alternative to standard Bitcoin-like transaction ledgers they also highlight potential shortcomings in terms of processing speed compared to Bitcoin. We nally present attacks and simulation results against blockchain protocols (both for Bitcoin and GHOST) that present natural upper barriers for the speed-security tradeo. By combining our positive and negative results we map the speed/security domain for blockchain protocols and list open problems for future work.},

@report{Zyskind2020,
   abstract = {The recent increase in reported incidents of surveillance and security breaches compromising users' privacy call into question the current model, in which third-parties collect and control massive amounts of personal data. Bitcoin has demonstrated in the financial space that trusted, auditable computing is possible using a decentralized network of peers accompanied by a public ledger. In this paper, we describe a decentralized personal data management system that ensures users own and control their data. We implement a protocol that turns a blockchain into an automated access-control manager that does not require trust in a third party. Unlike Bitcoin, transactions in our system are not strictly financial-they are used to carry instructions, such as storing, querying and sharing data. Finally, we discuss possible future extensions to blockchains that could harness them into a well-rounded solution for trusted computing problems in society.},

   abstract = {Proof-of-Stake blockchains based on a longest-chain consensus protocol are an attractive energy-friendly alternative to the Proof-of-Work paradigm. However, formal barriers to getting the incentives right were recently discovered, driven by the desire to use the blockchain itself as a source of pseudorandomness [4]. We consider instead a longest-chain Proof-of-Stake protocol with perfect, trusted, external randomness (e.g. a randomness beacon). We produce two main results. First, we show that a strategic miner can strictly outperform an honest miner with just 32.8% of the total stake. Note that a miner of this size cannot outperform an honest miner in the Proof-of-Work model [21]. This establishes that even with access to a perfect randomness beacon, incentives in Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake longest-chain protocols are fundamentally different. Second, we prove that a strategic miner cannot outperform an honest miner with 30.8% of the total stake. This means that, while not quite as secure as the Proof-of-Work regime, desirable incentive properties ofProof-of-Work longest-chain protocols can be approximately recovered via Proof-of-Stake with a perfect randomness beacon. The space of possible strategies in a Proof-of-Stake mining game is significantly richer than in a Proofof- Work game. Our main technical contribution is a characterization of potentially optimal strategies for a strategic miner, and in particular a proof that the corresponding infinite-state MDP admits an optimal strategy that is positive recurrent.},

   abstract = {In the paper we investigate consensus formation, from an economic perspective, in a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) based platform inspired by the Algorand blockchain. In particular, we consider PoS in relation to governance, focusing on two main issues. First we discuss alternative sampling schemes, which can be adopted to select voting committees and to define the number of votes of committee members. The selection probability is proportional to one’s stake and increases with it. Participation in governance allows users to affect the platform’s decisions as well as to obtain a reward. Then, based on such preliminary analysis, we introduce a microeconomic model to investigate the optimal stake size for a generic user. In the model we conceptualize an optimal stake, for a user, as striking the balance between having Algos immediately available for transactions and setting aside currency units to increase the probability of becoming a committee member. Our main findings suggest that the optimal stake can be quite sensitive to the user’s preferences and to the rules for selecting committees. We believe the findings may support policy decisions in PoS based platforms.},
